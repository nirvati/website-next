# Installing Nirvati

<div class="rounded-xl bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 py-2 px-6">

Nirvati can be installed on any Linux server with at least 4GB of RAM and 40GB of disk space. For the best experience, we recommend using a dedicated server or a virtual private server (VPS). [You can find the GNU/Linux installer here](https://get.nirvati.de).

**Please note:** Linux distributions without systemd are not supported at the moment (e.g., Devuan).

In addition, we provide pre-built images for specific hardware platforms, which can simplify the installation process.
