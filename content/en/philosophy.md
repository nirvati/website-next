# Nirvati Ecosystem Philosophy

## Empowering Through Freedom

At Nirvati, we believe that technology should be an enabler, not a restrictor. Our philosophy is grounded in the concept of “Libre,” which encompasses the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), thanks to n5i. FOSS represents the embodiment of freedom, choice, and empowerment.

By embracing FOSS values, we empower individuals, families, organizations, and even governments to have control over their digital lives. We provide choices that align with the essence of “Libre,” allowing users to decide how they interact with technology and data. This emphasis on freedom is at the core of our philosophy paired with versatility, security, data ownership and self-soverignty.

## The Liberation of Personal Clouds

**Empowering Users from All Walks of Life**

In an era where Big Tech corporations wield immense power and control over our digital data, we champion the cause of personal cloud ownership. Nirvati OS-based, while rooted in server technology, are designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that everyone, from tech enthusiasts to the technologically uninitiated, can regain ownership of their digital self-sovereignty.

From seasoned Bitcoin aficionados managing their nodes to those seeking to take charge of their digital destinies, our OSs provide the tools needed for individuals and organizations to reclaim their digital space.

## Our Selection of Kubernetes and n5i

**Foundations of Innovation and Scalability**

Our commitment to user freedom is reflected in our choice of Kubernetes and n5i as the foundation of the core ecosystem of Nirvati OS.

**The Backbone of Scalability**

Kubernetes plays a vital role as the orchestrator of our ecosystem. It enables us to provide scalable and flexible solutions that cater to diverse user needs. Just as Free “Libre” Software is about granting users the freedom to make choices, Kubernetes empowers us to offer an array of solutions, all built on the foundation of open and scalable technology that is ubiquitous in the industry.
