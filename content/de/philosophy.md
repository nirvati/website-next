# Nirvati Ecosystem Philosophy
## Libre: Empowering Through Freedom

At Nirvati, we believe that technology should be an enabler, not a restrictor. Our philosophy is grounded in the concept of “Libre,” which encompasses the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), thanks to n5i. FOSS represents the embodiment of freedom, choice, and empowerment.

By embracing FOSS values, we empower individuals, families, organizations, and even governments to have control over their digital lives. We provide choices that align with the essence of “Libre,” allowing users to decide how they interact with technology and data. This emphasis on freedom is at the core of our philosophy paired with versatility, security, data ownership and self-soverignty.
